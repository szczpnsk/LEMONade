### **1. Requirements**  
Define what is necessary to complete the project:  

- **Dataset Requirements**:  
  - Access to the **LEMON dataset** (Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset) containing data on personality traits, physiological responses, and brain activity.  
  - Ensure that the dataset is well-understood and preprocessed for analysis.  
  - Tools for loading, cleaning, and preparing the data.

- **Technical Requirements**:  
  - A programming environment (e.g., Python with Jupyter Notebooks).  
  - Tools and libraries for machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.  
  - GPU/CPU resources for handling large datasets.

- **Team Requirements**:  
  - Define roles for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and testing.  
  - Collaboration tools (e.g., GitHub, Google Drive).

### **2. Functionalities**  
Describe the key functionalities your project should implement:  

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handle missing values, normalization, and scaling of physiological and brain activity data.  
  - Transform categorical variables from personality traits into numerical form.  

- **Feature Extraction**:  
  - Extract key features (e.g., brain activity patterns, physiological markers like heart rate variability, personality scores).  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends to understand relationships between variables.  

- **Machine Learning Pipeline**:  
  - Implement models such as **logistic regression**, **random forests**, or **support vector machines (SVM)** for classification.  
  - Test advanced models, like **neural networks**, if the dataset size allows.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC to assess the model's performance.  

- **Stress Prediction**:  
  - Predict individuals' stress levels and coping styles using machine learning models.
