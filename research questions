#How do brain structure and physiological factors influence cognitive performance in younger vs. older adults?
- Why it's relevant: This could shed light on healthy aging and how the brain and body work together to maintain cognitive function.  
- Dataset focus: Use MRI data (brain structure), physiological measures, and cognitive test results.  

#Can we identify individuals' stress levels and coping styles based on their personality traits, physiological responses, and brain activity?
- Why it's relevant: Insights could help design personalized stress management strategies.  
- Dataset focus: Use personality test data, physiological measures, and EEG.  


### Steps to Tackle Research Question 2 or 3  
Here’s how you can approach these two research questions using the guidelines and steps from the files you shared:

### Research Question 2:  
*"How do brain structure and physiological factors influence cognitive performance in younger vs. older adults?"*

#### Steps  
1. Define Your Goals:  
   - Identify the cognitive tests from the dataset (e.g., working memory, verbal fluency).  
   - Select relevant brain structure features (MRI data) and physiological signals.  

2. Dataset Preprocessing:  
   - Extract and clean the cognitive performance data, MRI data, and physiological features.  
   - Normalize all numerical features (as shown in the data preprocessing section in the ML file).  

3. Data Exploration:  
   - Compare cognitive performance and physiological/brain structure data between younger and older adults.  
   - Use PCA or t-SNE for dimensionality reduction if MRI features are too complex.  

4. Model Choice:  
   - Use regression models if the target is continuous (e.g., memory test scores).  
   - Use classification models if grouping participants by cognitive performance levels (e.g., low, medium, high).  

5. Training and Evaluation:  
   - Train the model using physiological and MRI features to predict cognitive performance.  
   - Evaluate using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R² for regression, or accuracy for classification.  

6. Analysis:  
   - Compare feature importance to identify key brain and physiological factors influencing cognitive performance.

### Research Question 3:  
*"Can we identify individuals' stress levels and coping styles based on their personality traits, physiological responses, and brain activity?"*

#### Steps  
1. Define Your Goals:  
   - Use stress-related labels from the dataset (e.g., Perceived Stress Questionnaire, PSQ).  
   - Focus on personality traits (Big Five, emotional intelligence) and physiological features (e.g., heart rate, EEG).  

2. Dataset Preprocessing:  
   - Clean and preprocess the stress labels, personality data, and physiological measures.  
   - Normalize the features and handle missing values.  

3. Data Exploration:  
   - Visualize correlations between stress levels and predictors (e.g., stress vs. heart rate variability).  
   - Identify patterns in stress levels based on age or other demographics.  

4. Model Choice:  
   - Use classification if stress levels are categorical (e.g., low, medium, high).  
   - Use regression if stress is measured as a continuous variable (e.g., PSQ scores).  

5. Training and Evaluation:  
   - Train the model using personality and physiological data as input and stress levels as the output.  
   - Evaluate using metrics like accuracy (classification) or R² (regression).  

6. Analysis:  
   - Investigate which predictors (e.g., personality traits or physiological signals) have the most influence on stress levels.

### General Steps for Both Questions  
Based on the ML project guidelines from the file:  

1. Formulate the Research Question  
   - Clearly state your hypothesis. For example:
     - Question 2: Brain structure and physiological features significantly influence cognitive test results.
     - Question 3: Personality traits and physiological data can predict stress levels.

2. Choose the Dataset Accordingly  
   - Use subsets of the LEMON dataset:
     - For Question 2: Cognitive test scores, MRI, physiological features.  
     - For Question 3: Stress levels, personality traits, EEG, and physiological features.  

3. Data Preprocessing  
   - Standardize the data and handle missing values.  
   - Normalize numerical data using the formula:  
     \( x(i) = \frac{x(i) - \mu}{\sigma} \)  
     where \( \mu \) is the mean and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.  

4. Data Exploration  
   - Analyze correlations and relationships.  
   - Reduce dimensionality if needed (e.g., PCA for MRI data).  

5. Choose the ML Methodology  
   - For regression: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression.

   - For classification: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.  

6. Train and Fine-Tune the Model  
   - Train the model iteratively while monitoring loss curves.  
   - Tune hyperparameters to reduce overfitting (adjust regularization, etc.).  

7. Evaluate the Model  
   - For Question 2: Use regression metrics (MSE, R²).  
   - For Question 3: Use classification metrics (accuracy, F1-score).  

8. Present Results  
   - Follow the presentation structure from the ML file:  
     1. Research question and hypothesis.  
     2. Dataset and preprocessing.  
     3. Model training and evaluation.  
     4. Key findings and conclusions.
